### **Design Choices **

When deciding on the design of this website it took a lot of thinking and researching. The design of this website has been inspired by other similar kinds of websites but with its uniqueness. The colors that have been picked are colors that are very familiar with the JP Performance Cars brand and also provide a premium look.

To decide on which colors work best with the background and other accent's I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co").

#### Colors

As **JP Performance Cars** is primarily a **Ferrari** and Maserati supercar specialist I wanted colours that the customers of the brand identified straight away and also colours.

To make sure that there aren't difficulties with the contrast I have used the [contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker "Contrast Checker") to ensure a easy to read combination.

#### Fonts

When deciding fonts this came down to what the brand's image is trying to portray which is a luxurious high quality service this is why I have decided to use [Trajan Pro](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Trajan-Pro-Regular "JP Performance Cars Font").
